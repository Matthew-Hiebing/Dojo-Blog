# Blog Tutorial
This project is from an online tutorial by "The Net Ninja".  I'm going through this tutorial to learn more about React JS' functionality so I can use it in other projects I'm working on.

## Installation
First install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).  Once node is installed, install the following packages:

```bash
npm install react-dom 17.0.1
npm install react-router-dom 5.2.0
npm install react-scripts 4.0.1
npm install react 17.0.1
```
