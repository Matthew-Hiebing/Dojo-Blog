# Blog Tutorial
This project is from an online tutorial by "The Net Ninja".  I've refactored some of the project and added some of my own personal touches and I went through the course.

## Installation
First install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).  Once node is installed, install the following packages:

```bash
npm install react-dom 17.0.1
npm install react-router-dom 5.2.0
npm install react-scripts 4.0.1
npm install react 17.0.1
npm install json-server 0.16.3
npm install react-router-dom
```


## Run Instructions
Starts JSON server.  Run this command first.
```cmd
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

After running above JSON server command, open a new terminal and start node.
```cmd
npm start
```
